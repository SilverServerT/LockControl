## Implementation Priority

1. Token Security (Critical)
   - Current tokens have very long expiration (2062)
   - Tokens are exposed in config.js and localStorage
   - Immediate action required

2. Code Generation and Validation (High)
   - Current 6-digit codes are too short
   - No rate limiting on attempts
   - Implement within 1 week

3. Door Control Logic (High)
   - No verification of door state
   - Fixed unlock duration
   - Implement within 1 week

4. Physical Security (High)
   - Magnetic lock vulnerable to power loss
   - No backup power detection
   - Implement within 2 weeks

5. API Security (Medium)
   - No CSRF protection
   - Limited input validation
   - Implement within 2 weeks

6. Night Mode Security (Medium)
   - Based only on sun state
   - No manual override
   - Implement within 3 weeks

7. Logging and Monitoring (Medium)
   - Limited logging
   - No alert system
   - Implement within 3 weeks

8. Code Storage (Medium)
   - No encryption
   - Basic rotation
   - Implement within 4 weeks

9. Session Management (Low)
   - No timeouts
   - Basic device tracking
   - Implement within 4 weeks

10. Network Security (Low)
    - Basic MQTT setup
    - No network isolation
    - Implement within 5 weeks

## Notes
- All security improvements should be tested in a staging environment first
- Regular security audits should be performed
- Keep documentation updated with security changes
- Monitor for new security vulnerabilities
- Regular backup of security configurations
